# Create Xtensio App

If you want to start a new extension project the xtensio way, it's easier to use the `create-extension-app` CLI tool to get started.

## Creating a new Project

You can create a new project by running any of the below commands.

```bash
npx create-extension-app
# or
yarn create extension-app
# or
pnpm create extension-app
```

With the command above you'll be asked of your project name or you can just append that to any of the commands above.

Example:

```bash
yarn create extension-app <project-name>
```

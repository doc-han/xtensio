## What is xtensio?

**xtensio** (pronounced /**ɛkˈtɛn.ʃoʊ**/, like **"ex-TEN-see-oh"**) is javascript framework for building browser extensions. It leverages [React.js](https://reactjs.org) to provide a well-organized folder structure that supports a declarative approach, simplifying and accelerating extension development.

## How does it work?

**xtensio** provides you with a folder structure that comes with configurations already baked in. Hence, no configuration is needed to get started with your new extension project. Currently, it mainly supports React for development.
